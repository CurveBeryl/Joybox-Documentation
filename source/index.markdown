## Video games are the passion, Ruby the languaje & Ruby Motion the platform

Joybox combines the most popular and widely used 2D game engine for iOS, Cocos2D, folds in the amazing Box2D physics engine, and then wraps them up into a clean Ruby API that will make game development faster and more enjoyable for both beginners and experts alike.

## Getting started

A instalation using a gem is planned for the upcoming milestone, but right now you can start developing games just downloading the [demo application](https://github.com/rubymotion/Joybox/archive/master.zip) and modifying it to your needs.

## Feedback and Help
