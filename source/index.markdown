## Video games are the passion, Ruby the language & Ruby Motion the platform

Joybox combines the most popular and widely used 2D game engine for iOS, Cocos2D, folds in the amazing Box2D physics engine, and then wraps them up into a clean Ruby API that will make game development faster and more enjoyable for both beginners and experts alike.

## Getting started

Ruby Motion is required for using Joybox, its an amazing platform for creating iOS and OSX apps using Ruby! For install instructions: (http://www.rubymotion.com)

First install Joybox from RubyGems. Run:

```ruby
gem install joybox
```

Next, install the templates and command

```ruby
joybox install
```

Finally create a new project:

```
motion create --template=joybox-ios <name>

#or

motion create --template=joybox-osx <name>
```

# REPL Support

To enable the REPL in your proyect, please configure the following way in the app_delegate:

```ruby
@director = Joybox::Configuration.setup do
	debug repl:true
end
```

Warning: The REPL support will hit your game performance (aka Frames per Second), so please turn it off for shipping and performance tests.


Also you can test it without having a to create a game, using one of the following templates:

```
motion create --template=joybox-ios-example-repl <name>
motion create --template=joybox-osx-example-repl <name>
```

See it in action:

# Creating Classes

In this version you can generate Sprite, Layer and Scene subclasses and specs:

```
motion joybox:generate <sprite/layer/scene> <class_name>
```

## Troubleshoot Installation
If you run into troubles running your Joybox game, please do the following in the root folder of your project:

```
gem uninstall joybox -a

gem install joybox

rm .repl_history

rake clean

rake
```
