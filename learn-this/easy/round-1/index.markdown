![Joybox Asteroids](../../../images/learn-this/easy/round-1/game-screen.png)

In this path the game that we are going to create is a remake from a retro game from the year 1979: Asteroids! It will have some differences that you will notice along the way. But first lets get started by creating a Joybox project. Execute the following on your OSX terminal:

```sh
motion create --template=joybox-ios asteroids
```

This creates a regular RubyMotion project, with some differences:

* The director is already set up in the AppDelegate class.

* Some assets are included in the resources folder, they are needed to present useful game statistics on the screen.

The next thing we need to do is download the required assets for  this tutorial: [Round 1 Assets](../../../downloads/learn-this/easy/round-1/assets.zip), and place them in the resources folder.

Before we start with the game, we need to tell *RubyMotion* that the app will be for **iPad** only. This is accomplished by updating the *RakeFile* as follows:

```ruby
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
$:.unshift("/Library/RubyMotion/lib")
require 'motion/project/template/ios'
require 'joybox'

Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
  app.name = 'Asteroids'
	
  # Set the device family to iPad and the interface orientation to landscape left.
  app.device_family = [:ipad]
  app.interface_orientations = [:landscape_left]

  # Also set the icon that will be used in iOS Home Screen.
  app.icons = ['icon.png', 'icon@2x.png']
  app.prerendered_icon = true
end
```

### Menu

Well, we are now ready to begin with our main menu! For this we need to create a subclass of *Layer*, which is principally used to present objects on the screen and receive the user interaction. Lets create a folder named *layers* inside the **app** folder, then add a new file with the name *menu_layer.rb* and finally type the following inside it:

```ruby
class MenuLayer < Joybox::Core::Layer
	
	def on_enter

	end

end
```

[more-information] For more information about the Layers, see: [Layer documentation page](../../../documentation/layer).

In the previous code we are creating a subclass of Layer, named MenuLayer that will help us present two objects: The first will be the background of the menu and the other one will be the start button. Also notice that there is a method named *on_enter*. This method is going to get called when the Layer is presented on the screen, which is useful to initialize all the instances needed at the beginning of the layers life cycle.

The following step will place the menu's background image in the center of the layer. This is accomplished with the Sprite class. Sprites are regular two dimensional images that can be manipulated independently from others. Let's create one by adding the following code to the *on_enter* method:

```ruby
def on_enter
	background_sprite = Sprite.new file_name: 'sprites/menu/background.png', 
														position: Screen.center

	self << background_sprite
end
```

[more-information] For more information about the Sprites, see: [Sprite documentation page](../../../documentation/sprite).

With this we are creating a Sprite using the **background.png** image file and centering in the middle of the layer using the Screen class.

In order to render the Sprite on the screen it's required to add it to the layer. This is done by using the method *<<*, which you can notice in the last line.

### First Run
In order to be shown, our Layer is required to be contained in a class called *Scene*. Scenes represent stages of our game like the Levels or in this case Menus. For now you can think of them as little minigames. 

[more-information] For more information about the Scenes, see: [Scene documentation page](../../../documentation/scene).

Now lets create another folder with the name *scenes* and inside it a file named *menu_scene.rb*. Finally add the following code to create a subclass of Scene:

```ruby
class MenuScene < Joybox::Core::Scene
	
	def on_enter

	end	

end
```

The *on_enter* method works the same as with the layers, but in this case it will be called when the Scene is displayed. A perfect time to add our brand new MenuLayer to it:

```ruby
def on_enter
	menu_layer = MenuLayer.new

	self << menu_layer
end
```

As you may notice, the scenes should contain layers and at the same time the layers should contain sprites.

[tip This is the most standard architecture for the Game: Scenes << Layers << Sprites. On the other side that does not mean that you cannot adjust it to your game needs.]

Finally we can tell the Director that we want it to present the MenuScene. The Director is the class that controls almost everything in the game, like: which scene should be presented or pause the game when a phone call enters.

[more-information] For more information about the Director, see: [Director documentation page](../../../documentation/director).

If you open the *app_delegate.rb* file, you should see the following method:

```ruby
def application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions)

  @director = Joybox::Configuration.setup do
    director display_stats: true
  end

  @navigation_controller = UINavigationController.alloc.initWithRootViewController(@director)
  @navigation_controller.navigationBarHidden = true

  @window = UIWindow.alloc.initWithFrame(UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds)
  @window.setRootViewController(@navigation_controller)
  @window.makeKeyAndVisible
  true
end
```

This is the required set up for our game and for the purpose of this tutorial we will not look deeply into it. Just add the following line into the bottom of the method:

```ruby
  ...

  # With the following we tell the director to present the MenuScene when the game starts.
  @director << MenuScene.new
  true
end
```

We are ready to run our game from the first time, which you can do by running the following command on your OSX terminal:

```sh
rake
```

If everything succeeds you should see the following on your iOS Simulator:

### Round 2
With this we conclude the first round of the easy level! In the next round we finish our game menu learning how to add multiple layers into a scene and buttons to our game!
