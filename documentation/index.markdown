From Audio to Physics, everything you need to know about the Joybox classes is in here! Every class contains useful examples about its use, but if you need more information you can see the specifications in the [Project Repository](https://github.com/rubymotion/Joybox/tree/master/spec/motion).

You can also access the documentation offline, downloading the [Joybox Docset](dash-feed://http%3A%2F%2Fjoybox.io%2Fdocset%2FJoybox.xml).

[tip If you are new to Joybox, can we recommend visit the 'Learn this' section first?]

### Essentials
The every day classes are included in this section: Here you can find how to configure the game, use the game loop, present scenes and layers, render sprites or get the maximum of each of the frames per second using a sprite sheet.

|   |   |   |
|:--|:--|:--|
| [more-information][Director](director) | [more-information][Layer](layer) | [more-information][Layer Color](layer-color) |
| [more-information][Scene](scene) | [more-information][Sprite](sprite) | [more-information][Sprite Batch](sprite-batch) |
| [more-information][Sprite Frame Cache](sprite-frame-cache) |

### User Interface
Build amazing introduction screens, settings sections, high scores or callouts for your game! Using the user interface classes you will be able to create menus with image or label items or add a Game Heads-up Display (HUD) rendering labels in game.

### Actions & Animations
Have fun while polishing your game using any of these amazing effects or animations: move your final stage boss, spawn some enemies here and there or why not add a retro touch with an immunity blink?

### Physics Environment
Bring realism to the game with physics simulation! Using the World and Body class: having gravity or bouncing will not be any trouble at all, and at the same time simplify the collision detection or ray casting with this ruby style callbacks.

### Sounds & Music
Blip Blip Blip! Make an involving experience adding sound effects to each action of the game or a drama background theme when the main character finally saves the Princess. May we suggest adding the "This plays best with headphones" label to your game?
