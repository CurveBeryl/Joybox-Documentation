The BackgroundAudio class supports the playback of background music for the Game Scenes. The Audio files are loaded into the instance using keys, which also are used to tell which audio must be played. The supporting file formats are: AAC, HE-ACC, AMR, ALAC, iLBC, IMA4, Linear PCM (Uncompressed), Âµ-Law, a-Law and MP3.

Even if it has it's own volume, stop, and resume methods, they can be overridden by the Audio module mute and enable methods.

[warning The simultaneous playback of multiple background audios is not supported, the play method will check for an existing playing audio and will stop it before it plays the new one. The playback of background music and sound effects is supported by mixing the BackgroundAudio and AudioEffect classes.]
