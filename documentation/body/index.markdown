The Body class represents a chunk of matter in the Physics Environment, and it holds all the properties that cannot be seen or touched, like Mass, Velocity, Location or Angle. To give the body a shape and a density it is required to be complemented with one or more Fixtures. For more information, see the [Fixture documentation page](../fixture).

They are three different types of bodies:

* Static
The Static bodies does not react to gravity or forces and behave as if they have infinite mass, though they can be moved manually by changing its position instance variable.

* Kinematic 
Similar to the Static Bodies, the Kinematic Bodies do not react to forces, but they move according to their velocity properties. It is common to move them by changing their velocity, but that also can be archived through the position property.

* Dynamic
Different from the Static and Kinematic bodies, the Dynamic bodies have finite mass and react to forces. They can be moved by reacting to gravity, by applying a force, or by changing their velocity or position properties.

[note When a Body is moved, it's complemented fixtures will move accordingly.]

[warning The Body class cannot be instantiated by itself, it is required to be created using the World's new body method.]

[more-information] For more information, see: [Box2D Manual](http://box2d.org/manual.pdf)

### ::Static
### ::Kinematic 
### ::Dynamic
Constants that represent the types of the bodies:

```ruby
body = @world.new_body position: [1, 1], type: Body::Dynamic
```

### New
Using the World's New Body method we can create new instance of the class Body:

```ruby
body = @world.new_body position: [100, 100] do
	# This block can be used to complement the body with different fixtures
end
```

For more information on how to add Fixtures, see the [New Fixture method](#new-fixture)

### Fixtures
Returns the list of the Fixtures added to the Body:

```ruby
body.fixtures.each do |fixture|
	p "Body Fixture: #{fixture}"
end
```

### New Fixture
To add a new Fixture to the Body its required to have a Shape. The following Shapes are available:

* Edge, see: [EdgeShape documentation page](../edge-shape)

* Polygon, see: [PolygonShape documentation page](../polygon-shape)

* Circle, see: [CircleShape documentation page](../circle-shape)

* Chain, see: [ChainShape documentation page](../chain-shape)

The New Fixture method combines the creation of the Shape and the Fixture, and takes as parameters the options of both classes:

```ruby
body.new_fixture do
	edge_fixture start_point: [0, 0],
						 end_point: [100, 100],
						 friction: 1,
						 restitution: 2,
						 density: 3
						 is_sensor: true
end
```

The options **start_point:** and **end_point:** belong to the EdgeShape class and **friction:**, **restitution:**, **density:** and **is_sensor:** belongs to the Fixture class. Also as you have already notice the method invoked is *edge_fixture*, which indicates what kind of Shape we are creating. Following this the three other methods are: *polygon_fixture*, *circle_fixture*, *chain_fixture*.

Here is an example creating a Fixture with a Polygon Shape:

```ruby
body.new_fixture do
	polygon_fixture vertices: [[0, 0], [16, 0], [0, 16]],
						      friction: 1,
						      restitution: 2,
						      density: 3
						      is_sensor: true
end
```

Or using the Circle Shape options:

```ruby
body.new_fixture do
	circle_fixture radius: 60
end
```

To know which parameters are required for each shape visit its documentation page.

[tip You can create new Fixtures in the block parameter passed at the creation of a Body.]

#### Fixture Options
**friction:** - Float - Default: 0.2
Sets the friction of the Fixture.

**restitution:** - Float - Default: 0.0
Initial restitution of the Fixture.

**density:** - Float - Default: 0.0
Density the new Fixture.

**is_sensor:** - Boolean - Default: false
Sensors are Fixtures which enable knowing when Bodies are touching but not simulating the collision. 

### Destroy Fixture
Remove an Fixture composed in the Body:

```ruby
fixture = body.fixtures[0]

body.destroy_fixture fixture
```

### Apply Force
Applies a force to a Body:

```ruby
body.apply_force force: [200, 200]
```

[tip You can apply forces subtracting the end and start point of a User touch on the Screen.]

#### Options
**location:** - Point - Defaults: Body's Center
Body location where the force will be applied.

**as_impulse:** - Boolean - Defaults: true
When a force is applied as an impulse the Body's linear velocity will change immediately, otherwise the velocity will change gradually over time.

### Apply Torque
Applies a torque to a Body:

```ruby
body.apply_torque torque: 30
```

#### Options
**as_impulse:** - Boolean - Defaults: true
When a torque is applied as an impulse the Body's angular velocity will change immediately, otherwise the velocity will change gradually over time.
